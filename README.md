## **Description**

The stock market offers significant profit potential but also comes with inherent risks due to price volatility. This project focuses on developing accurate stock price prediction models using machine learning and statistical techniques to aid informed decision-making for investors.

## **Objective**: <br>

Our main goal is to predict the closing prices of Bitcoin (BTC), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Cardano (ADA) using various models:

- Linear Regression
- Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)
- Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
- Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
- AR-MOS
- Hybrid Models
- FEDformer

We evaluate these models based on metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).
